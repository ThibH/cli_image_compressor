Simon's Image Compressor is a free and opensource software to compress images from many
formats to .jpg format.
- Quality is defaulted to 75 in a scale from 1 (lower quality) to 95 (higher quality),
but you can change it (with the '--quality' option of the 'compress' command, or by letting
yourself be guided.
- Destination folder is defaulted to the Downloads folder. But if it doesn't exist, you will
be asked to specify your destination folder.
- Compressed images will keep the same name, or will be potentially renamed with a
numbered suffix added to the name if a file with the same name and extension already exists
in the destination folder.

Enjoy !
